# CS-210-Final
The final (third) project for SNHU CS-210 C++

This project is intended to be used as a data analytics software for the company Corner Grocer. The program opens the daily purchase log text file, counts the occurences of each item by name, and creates a backup file with the map data. It then allows the user to choose between searching for specific item's occurence frequency, all frequencies or a generated histogram. 

The app effectively handles files and inputs, checking for errors and handling them without crashing. The code could be improved by allowing for a wider range of file inputs, such as CSV or xlsx, as well as by enabling more advanced analytics than simple histograms. 

The most challenging part of this project was ensuring type-safety between the map and its keys and values. This was overcome by using the 'auto' type for passing critical data between funcitons. This project has allowed me to become fully confident in using Visual Studio and the fundamentals of C++ programming to solve a real-world problem. This also improved my confidence in many soft skills, like writing documentation, interpreting client needs and writing efficient and clean code. 

This challenge has improved my ability in programming and problem-solving. By keeping strong, clear documentation and focusing on structuring the code into functional blocks, the code created is easy to read, debug and iterate on.
